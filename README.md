# Third Year Project
This Repository is for a 3rd Year Project for the module 'Professional Pratice in IT' in Software Development GMIT 2017. 

# Introduction
For my Third Year Project, I will be making an Ionic 2 mobile app using a MEAN stack. I will be explaining below what Ionic and MEAN stack mean and the technologies used with them. I will give an Overview of my project and a guide on how to create an Ionic 2 app and run it. This project will also contain a Wiki as a design document.

# Ionic
Ionic is the world's most popular cross-platform mobile development technology. Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially small websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access to the native platform layer. Speed of development and access to 3rd party code are some of the many benefits of hybrid apps. Ionic acts as the front-end UI framework that handles all of the design and UI interactions. Simliar to Bootstrap with a broad range to common native mobile components, animations and design features. 

Ionic 2.0.0 was released in 2017, with improved performance and reduced the complexity of the code making it easier to create apps. 

# MEAN 
MEAN is an abbreviation which stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular2 and Nodejs. The MEAN stack is a collection of javascript based technologies used to develop web applications. Nodejs and Express is used to build the server. The app will make http calls to the server to retrieve/POST data. The server will hook up to the Mongo Database. There are two sides to the stack, the front-end and the back-end. The only thing connecting the two will be HTTP calls.  So you will build the server/databse totally separate and different than the front end.
