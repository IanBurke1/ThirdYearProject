# Introduction
For my Third Year Project, I will be making an Ionic 2 mobile app using a MEAN stack. I will be explaining below what Ionic and MEAN stack mean and the technologies used with them. I will give an Overview of my project and a guide on how to create an Ionic 2 app and run it. This project will also contain a Wiki as a design document.
